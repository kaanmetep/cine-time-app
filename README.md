# CineTime App

CineTime allows you to fetch information about the movies or TV shows from a third party API. You can view details of the films that you select, rate them, and save them to your watched list. This project serves as a means to reinforce my learning of React and, simultaneously, enhance my skills in using Tailwind CSS for the first time.

## Features

- Users can add the movies they have rated to their "watched" list.
- Users cannot add the same movie to the watched list more than once.
- Users can delete movies from the watched list.
- Movies added to the "watched" list are stored in the localStorage.
- Users can see the total number of movies added to their watched list and the total duration of these movies in minutes.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind
