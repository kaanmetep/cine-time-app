# CineTime App

CineTime allows you to fetch information about the movies or TV shows you've watched from a third party API. You can view details of the films, rate them, and save them to your watched list. This project serves as a means to reinforce my learning of React and, simultaneously, enhance my skills in using Tailwind CSS for the first time.
